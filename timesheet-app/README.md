# TimeSheet App
This is simple timesheet app that I put together to show how to use React.js to build User Interface to capture and display data.  
It uses MongoDB, a NoSql datatore on the backend and Node's Express.js middleware.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
