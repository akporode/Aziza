# TimeSheet App
This is simple timesheet app that I put together to demonstrate how to use React.js to build UI to capture and display data. It uses MongoDB, a NoSql database, on the backend and Express.js web middleware.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

Install mongodb

follow
* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux/#run-mongodb-community-edition) - install instructions


```
after installing MongoDb, import timesheet app data into MongoDb by executing mongoimport command

mongoimport --db test --collection timesheets --drop --file timesheets.json
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
